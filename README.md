# BoxOut (a novel puzzle game by Hang Pham)

BoxOut is a novel puzzle game made by Hang Pham, currently with 7-outside-of-the-box challenges to solve with engaging music and sound effect. The game takes inspiration from Blackbox, which was developed and designed by Ryan McLeod. The targeted audience for BoxOut is people from 15 to 40 years old. Note that this game has only been tested on Windows OS, not Mac OS. Therefore, playing on Mac OS might lead to incompatible fonts and other issues.

## Guide to Game
Each puzzle level of the game will have a circle/circle outline, and players must utilize the mouse and keys to solve the puzzles on the screen with minimal instructions. The puzzle is solved when the circle is filled completely. More instructions are available within the game. 

## Installation
Use a Java Integrated Development Environment, such as Eclipse, to run the code. Every file but the README.md, SOLUTIONS.md, and Advertisement for BoxOut.pdf files are required for the game to function.


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome but please credit Hang Pham. As this project was developed with a relatively intermediate knowledge of programming (based on knowledge taught in school), the code might not be the most optimal. Additionally, note that the game has only been tested on Windows OS, not MAC OS. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.
